Published research paper for implementation of Flint Programming Language.

---

As part of a UROP, I expanded the Flint Programming Language from a proof of concept.

Supervised by Professors Susan Eisenbach and Sophia Drossopoulou, I worked on the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06534) and code relating to the new features designed to make smart contracts more robust and safe.

We've now released this as an [open source compiler on GitHub](https://github.com/flintlang/flint/).
