# Distinguised WebApps Project 2019

The 2nd Year Computing Group Projects (commonly referred to as WebApps) require students to build a web-based or mobile-based application. Students are given free reign on what type of program to build and this results in a variety of project types.

Our work on inkstep led to being awarded joint 3rd place for the 2018/2019 academic year.
