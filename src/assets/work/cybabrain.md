First founding experience to support freelancing career in web development and video editing.

---

Harnessing my drive as a 12 year old for making spare pocket money lead to the founding of my first company. CybaBrain (supporting a freelancing career) provided me a tenacity, business awareness, and customer focus that is difficult to gain without making mistakes and putting real money on the line.

## Web Development
Bespoke small business LAMP & django websites decreasing bounce rates by *60%* and increasing goal completion by *25%*. Programmed custom content management systems (CMS) and client scheduling applications.

### Examples:
- North London Yoga Centre (2011): northlondonyogacentre.com
- Reap Research
- Harmony and Light
- Nottub
- Sally's Beauty: Private scheduling system

## Video Editing
Created Vox Populi for market research companies to present to blue chip brands (e.g. Boots, Dixons, Homebase and Bonmarché) preventing the loss of thousands to the bottom line.
