Joined in the first cohort of interns at a Deep Technology talent investor, aiding in fundraising and new talent leads.

EF is an pre-seed investment programme that helps technical founders build Deep Technology companies.

I joined some seriously impressive people within the Talent team to aid with:

- Fund Launch Party (finding details for 300+ Market Leading Investors, Journalists and Entrepreneurs and purchasing vital items for it)

- Finding 86 new talent leads through the "City to Startup" scheme from companies such as Accenture, McKinsey & Co, The Economist, JP Morgan.
