Provided emotional support and practical information to callers in distress anonymously and confidentially.

This was one of my most difficult roles. It was intense emotionally and physically due to intense night shifts, however this gave me a certain resilience and understanding that, I believe, cannot be acquired elsewhere.

During preparation for the lines, I went through listening skills training for a month: This had a strong focus on non-judgemental, empathetic and adaptive listening. Thousands of students contact London Nightline every year from all over the capital, and from distance learning students around the world. As a Hotline Volunteer, I helped provide the opportunity to talk things through and come to their own conclusions, to work out how they feel and what they really want.

While an active volunteer, I did overnight shifts 8am-8pm, in at minimum pairs ready on the lines and provided emotional support to numerous callers.
